# Integrating project Voice assistant component
## Introduction
This comprehensive project introduces a prototype that integrates an Alexa voice assistant with a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to enhance the functionality of a smart laboratory. Currently, clinical laboratories lack a notification mechanism for the creation and tracking of emergency orders. Consequently, doctors or supervisors frequently need to communicate with laboratory personnel to inquire about the status of their orders, leading to interruptions in their workflow as they locate and address emergency orders. The primary goal of this integrative project is to develop an Alexa skill capable of interacting with the Orion system through voice commands. This innovation ensures that operators are not required to physically check the system on the equipment, thus embracing the concept of hands-free operation. Additionally, the project suggests incorporating a feature in the Alexa skill to generate reminders for outstanding emergency orders, preventing them from being overlooked.
